## Services and formats

Under <https://api.salamanca.school>, we provide the following endpoints^[In the context of RESTful APIs, these endpoints respond to GET requests only, in other words, the resources are read-only.]:

* **/tei/** for [TEI P5](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html) xml (this is also being redirected to from <https://tei.salamanca.school/>)
* **/txt/** for plaintext
* **/rdf/** for linked data (in [rdf/xml](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/); this is also being redirected to from <https://data.salamanca.school/>)
* **/html/** for web views (this is also being redirected to from <https://www.salamanca.school/>)
* **/iiif/** for iiif [manifests](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/) and [images](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/)
* (in the future: pdf and ebook for ebook views)
* (also in the future, (some of) the endpoints will be enhanced with versioning/[memento](http://mementoweb.org/guide/howto/) negotiation)

These services are also accessible directly at <https://id.salamanca.school/>, where the actual service delivered is determined via [content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) if the client signals to expect (via the [HTTP request's accept header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z3)) the following mime types, or by requesting the respective file extension explicitly (file extensions having a higher priority than accept headers):

* `application/tei+xml` (recommended), `application/xml` or `text/xml` or the file ending `.xml` for TEI P5 xml
* `text/plain` or the file ending `.txt` for plaintext
* `application/rdf+xml` or the file ending `.rdf` for rdf/xml
* `application/xhtml+xml` (recommended) or `text/html` or the file ending `.html` for web views
* `image/jpeg` or the file ending `.jpg` for images
* `application/ld+json; profile=http://iiif.io/presentation/3/context.json` or the file ending `.mf.json` for iiif manifests

Taken without file extension and outside of a http exchange, urls at <https://id.salamanca.school/> are also used to represent the abstract entities that scholarly works or discourse concepts are.

## Parts of texts

All the endpoints follow a common scheme for identification of what part of the work will be exposed in the requested format:

In general the identificator is `{work}\[:{location}\]`, where the work must, and the location can be specified in more detail:

`work` is `{collection}.{id}[.{version}]`, e.g. `works.w0015`, `works.w0002.orig` or `lemma.l0020`. (Note that we yet have to use or accept lowercase ids, for the time being, it's "W0015" with a capital "W".) "version" refers to the distinction between the original/diplomatic text (requested with `orig`) and the edited/constituted variant (requested with `edit`) that is available in some formats (such as plaintext).

`location` can be either a page number, preceded by a 'p' (e.g. "p23", "pFOL3R"), or a section identifier in a hierarchical manner, e.g. "frontmatter.1", "5.1", "vol2.3.11" etc. In this scheme, volumes are prefixed with "vol", footnotes or marginal notes are prefixed with "n", and all other sections such as chapters, subchapters, paragraphs etc. are rendered with plain numbers. Pages are outside of the chapter hierarchy, but below the volume and front- and backmatter identifier, giving locations as "p53" (for a page in the body of a single-volume work) and "vol2.frontmatter.p1" (for a page in the frontmatter of a multi-volume work).

Here are some example identificators:

* <https://id.salamanca.school/works.W0013:vol1.1.1.n1>
* <https://id.salamanca.school/works.W0004:pFOL7V>
* <https://id.salamanca.school/works.W0013:vol2.frontmatter.p1>

(This way of identifying sections is inspired by the [Canonical Text Services](http://cite-architecture.github.io/ctsurn/overview/) specification, but diverges in some points, such as http instead of urn scheme and the eschewal of ranges and subreferences.^[Cf. <https://blog.salamanca.school/de/2016/11/15/whats-in-a-uri-part-1/>, also mentioning more literature.] Depending on user feedback, we may implement this later.)

## Endpoint-specific information

### TEI endpoint

The TEI endpoint provides access to the sources that form the basis of all our information offers. Whereas the works are sometimes split into several parts to reflect the structure of multi-volume works or for technical reasons, and while some information in the header is maintained in an external file, this endpoint resolves all of this and delivers one complete and integral TEI file. Since the extraction of parts of a work can result in invalid TEI or even malformed xml, this endpoint at the moment does not use the location identifier and offers access only to whole works.

### Plaintext endpoint

The plaintext endpoint offers access to an on-the-fly plaintext rendering of our texts. Generally, this rendering works in two modes: original and constituted (default), which can be requested explicitly by appending an `.orig` or an `.edit` to the work identifier.

In both modes, whitespace is normalized (linebreaks are suppressed), paragraphs are separated by blank lines, marginal notes are wrapped in braces (and preceded by some whitespace: "`   {}`"). List items are prefixed with hashes or dashes (`#`/`-`), depending on the list type being numbered or unnumbered.

Obviously, in cases where an original and an edited text exists, which of those two is being rendered depends on the mode as well. This applies to editorial corrections, expansions of abbreviations and normalizations.

In "constituted" mode, sections that have editorial labels get these wrapped in square brackets and asterisks ("`[ *` ... `* ]`"). Milestones such as article boundaries are represented by either daggers, asterisks or asterisks in brackets (`†`, `*`, `[*]`), depending on the way they appear in the sources, in "diplomatic" mode whereas in "constituted" mode, they are wrapped in brackets and eventually represented by their editorial label (e.g. "`[article 12]`").

In "constituted" mode, terms or names of persons that are treated in the dictionary get their dictionary lemma appended in brackets and arrow (e.g. "`Los mandamientos de la ley diuina [→lex divina]: son diez ...`"). The same also holds for citations where this does not refer to dictionary entries but may serve to find and consolidate references to specific works.

### RDF endpoint

Similar to the TEI endpoint, whatever the specific part of a work was that semantic information was requested for, this endpoint always returns the information for the full work, which contains the requested information (semantic web clients should be able to cope with this).

The information includes **metadata** about the work (such as title, author, publisher etc.) using the [SPAR ontologies](http://www.sparontologies.net/) (in particular, the [fabio ontology](http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/fabio)). **Structural information** about front- and backmatter, chapters, paragraphs etc. (the type of entities, a label and sometimes information on what other entity they are contained in) is recorded using SPAR's [document component ontology (doco)](http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/doco). Information about **citations and references** to persons, places or other works is recorded using SPAR's [citation typing ontology (cito)](http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/cito) and using [schema.org's "Book" vocabulary](https://schema.org/Book). We use the [getty thesaurus of geographic names](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html), the ["gemeinsame Normdatei" of the German National Library](http://www.dnb.de/DE/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html) and the [thesaurus of the Consortium of European Research Libraries](https://data.cerl.org/thesaurus/_search) as authority data sources.

Finally, information **about the dataset** as a whole (like provenance, authorship etc.) is provided using the [VoID Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/). This information is available on its own at <http://data.salamanca.school/void.ttl> and is linked to from all individual resources.

### HTML endpoint

This endpoint also accepts the following url parameters:

* `viewer` with an url-encoded url of a iiif canvas contained in the present work (e.g. <https://facs.salamanca.school/iiif/presentation/W0015/canvas/p14>) to open the facsimile viewer also
* `q` with a search term to be highlighted in the html
* `mode` with either "orig" or "edit" to select viewing mode
* `lang` to control the language of the user interface

Since the projects' html files are very huge in some cases, it was necessary to split them and load them incrementally in the background. This makes a translation from work/passage identifiers to html anchors necessary, and the html endpoint redirects to <https://www.salamanca.school/work.html>, where the actual resource is constructed from the parameters mentioned above, from the translation process and eventually from environment factors like the browser's language preference settings. This way, <https://id.salamanca.school/works.W0015:20.2.4.10> might resolve finally to <https://www.salamanca.school/en/work.html?wid=W0015&frag=0005_W0015-00-0016-d1-03ed#W0015-00-0022-d4-03f7>.
